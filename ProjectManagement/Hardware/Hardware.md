## Supplies Needed
As of January 24, 2024 
### From the Starter Kit (Uno R3 Project):

1\. **Arduino Uno/Nano:**

   - Use one Arduino Uno or Nano for each room.

2\. **Jumper Wires:**

   - Use these wires for connecting components on your breadboard.

3\. **Temperature Sensor (DS18B20):**

   - Utilize the DS18B20 temperature sensor from the starter kit for accurate temperature readings.

4\. **Relay Module:**

   - If the starter kit includes a relay module, use it for controlling the thermostat.

### From the Super Learning Kit (Lafvin):

1\. **Motion Sensor (PIR):**

   - Use the PIR motion sensor from the Lafvin kit for detecting motion in each room.

2\. **Breadboard:**

   - Use the breadboard from the Lafvin kit for prototyping and connecting components.

3\. **LEDs and Resistors:**

   - LEDs and resistors from the Lafvin kit can be used for visual feedback or testing purposes.

### General Components from Both Kits:

1\. **Power Supply:**

   - Check if the kits include power supplies. If not, use a suitable external power supply for your Arduino boards.

2\. **Push Buttons:**

   - These can be used for manual input or as a fallback control method.

3\. **Potentiometers:**

   - Potentiometers can be used for adjusting settings manually or for testing.

### Additional Considerations:

1\. **LCD Display (If Available):**

   - If either kit includes an LCD display, you can use it to show temperature readings or system status.

2\. **Servo Motors (If Available):**

   - Servo motors might be used for controlling air vents or other mechanisms based on room priority.

3\. **IR Receiver and Remote (If Available):**

   - If available, an IR receiver and remote can be used for additional control options.

4\. **Additional Sensors (If Available):**

   - Check if the kits include other sensors like humidity sensors that might enhance your system.

Remember to refer to the documentation provided with each kit for details on component specifications and usage. You may need to adapt the project based on the specific components available in your kits. If any critical components are missing, you may need to consider purchasing them separately.
