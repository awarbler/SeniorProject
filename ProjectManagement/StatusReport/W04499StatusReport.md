# Accomplishments: 
Copied instruction to GitHub how to hook up the PIR HC SR501 Motion Sensor  
Figure out how to use breadboard for the devices
 ### Task: Verify temperature readings and sensor accuracy #15
    - Verify Temperature Readings
    - Observe the Serial Monitor for temperature (and humidity, if using DHT22) readings.
    - Verify that the temperature readings seem reasonable and respond to changes in the environment.
    - If you are using the DHT22, also check the humidity readings.
    - If the readings appear inaccurate, double-check the wiring and ensure that you are using the correct library and example sketch.
 ### Testing Power Check  #69
 After programming the UNO for subtask 2, 
 disconnect the UNO from the computer and 
 power it from a wall power supply and make sure 
 that it can still turn on the LED in response to the button press
 Enter Notes into Visual Studio
