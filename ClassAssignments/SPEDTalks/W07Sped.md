# Non-Relational Databases: An Overview

## Introduction
Marissa Miller, a software engineering student, has chosen to speak about non-relational databases for her speech.

Relational databases, which are more traditional, are stored in table format with specific pieces and types of data managed and manipulated by SE. They consist of columns and rows, and relationships between tables can be established to link related information.

Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL or Not Only SQL databases, store data in non-tabular formats and are useful when dealing with large volumes of complex and diverse data. They are particularly helpful for rapidly evolving applications that require a dynamic database capable of adapting quickly.

Popular non-relational databases include Firebase, Firestore, and MongoDB. Different types of non-relational databases include key-value pair, document-oriented, column-oriented, and graph databases.

Examples of popular non-relational databases include Amazon DynamoDB (key-value pair), MongoDB (document-oriented), Apache Cassandra (column-oriented), and Amazon Neptune (graph database).

## Pros and Cons of Non-Relational Databases
- Non-relational databases offer flexibility in data modeling due to the lack of constraints from a relational schema, allowing for scalability and adaptability to meet demands without sacrificing functionality.

- They are easy to use and require less lines of code, making them adaptable and accommodating for modern applications.

- Strict data consistency is a challenge and can lead to data integrity issues if not managed properly.

- Queries are typically less complex than those provided by SQL, posing challenges in complex data retrieval and tasks.

- There is a learning curve for those who have been using relational databases for a while, but non-relational databases are important and worth exploring further.
